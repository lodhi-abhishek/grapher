# Grapher Github pages Branch

A graph plotting software very simple not too much complex built using javascript. Functions like Polynomial, Logarithmic, Trignometric and Exponential Functions. Additionally, it can calculate the roots and intercepts of Functions by giving the guess.

We use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling the javascript files  & [expr-eval](https://npmjs.com/package/expr-eval) node library for evaluating the 
expression.
